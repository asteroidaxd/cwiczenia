[Intro: Sematary]
Ahh

[Chorus: Ghost Mountain]
I'm the Wickerman, I am made of pain
Runnin' up a hill in the rain
Got red dot pointed at your brain
Ghost Mountain gon' keep it in range
Wickerman, I am made of pain
I'm the wagoner, creepin' down the way
Trench knife, got the wartime blade
Sematary gon' put you in the grave

[Verse 1: Ghost Mountain]
Living out a hearse, come ride with me
Cry out my name from the trees
Scars on me, call it surgery
Hit the lights, no emergency
I'll fly with you
Pins and needles fill my room
Tryna feel nothing
Take me out and show me pain

[Chorus: Ghost Mountain & Sematary]
I'm the Wickerman, I am made of pain
Runnin' up a hill in the rain
Got red dot pointed at your brain
Ghost Mountain gon' keep it in range
Wickerman, I am made of pain (Ahh)
I'm the wagoner, creepin' down the way
Trench knife, got the wartime blade (Ahhhh)
Sematary gon' put you in the grave

[Verse 2: Sematary]
I'm a normal boy, I'm a normal kid
But if you try, turn you to a Skellington
Blood all over me, damn, I tried again
But I'm still alive, stay rocking 'til the end
I'm with Ghost Mountain, we do not repent
Got a chainsaw, shotgun with a bayonet
I see all your friends, waiting by the edge
Say goodbye, meet them on the Rainbow Bridge
Up at 5 AM
Seen the Wickerman
All hail Ghost Mountain
Watch out for Grave Man
Yeah, I hurt myself today
Every dog has his days
I'm stuck up in my ways
I'm in so much pain

[Chorus: Ghost Mountain]
I'm the Wickerman, I am made of pain
Runnin' up a hill in the rain
Got red dot pointed at your brain
Ghost Mountain gon' keep it in range
Wickerman, I am made of pain
I'm the wagoner, creepin' down the way
Trench knife, got the wartime blade
Sematary gon' put you in the grave
